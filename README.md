# Assembly-Projects
Lab projects for ECE 222 - Digital Computers at the University of Waterloo. My lab partner Austin Wong and I wrote the projects in ARM Assembly and deployed on a Keil MCB1700B board with a LPC1768 microcontroller.

## Labs
Note that each lab used code/knowledge acquired in the last one, therefore:

* Subroutines are often copied to the next lab
* The most refined/clear/best version of a give subroutine is probably in Lab 4.

1. **Introduction to ARM** - Make an LED flash at 1 Hz.
2. **Subroutines and Parameter Passing** - Morse code transmitter. Flash the a morse code word on the LED.
3. **Input/Output Interfacing** - Measure reaction time by flashing lights and counting how long it takes from when the light starts flashing to the user pressing a button.
4. **Interrupt Handling** - Same as Lab 3, except handle the button press by writing an interrupt service routine.
