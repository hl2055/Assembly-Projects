# Assembly-Projects
Lab projects for UWaterloo ECE 222 - Digital Computers. My lab partner Austin Wong and I wrote the projects in ARM Assembly and deployed on a Keil MCB1700B board with a LPC1768 microcontroller. 

1. Introduction to ARM - Make an LED flash at 1 Hz
2. Subroutines and Parameter Passing - Morse code transmitter. Flash the LED a morse code word.
3. Input/Output Interfacing - Measure reaction time by flashing lights and counting how long it takes from when the light starts flashing to the user pressing a button.
4. Interrupt Handling - Same as Lab 3, except handle the button press by writing an interrupt service routine.
